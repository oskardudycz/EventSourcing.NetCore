# Implementing Distributed Processes

Distributed process management using Guest Group Checkout as the example domain.

It was modelled and explained in detail in the [Implementing Distributed Processes Webinar](https://www.architecture-weekly.com/p/webinar-3-implementing-distributed):

It shows how to:
- orchestrate and coordinate a business workflow spanning across multiple aggregates using the [Saga pattern](./HotelManagement/Sagas), [Choreography](./HotelManagement/Choreography) and [Process Managers](./HotelManagement/ProcessManagers),
- handle distributed processing both for asynchronous command scheduling and event publishing,
- getting at-least-once delivery guarantee,
- implementing command store and outbox pattern on top of Marten and EventStoreDB,
- unit testing aggregates and Sagas with a little help from [Ogooreck](https://github.com/oskardudycz/Ogooreck),
- testing asynchronous code.
